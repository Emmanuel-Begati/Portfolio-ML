# Data Preprocessing and Modeling Pipeline

This project involves preparing a dataset for training machine learning models. The primary steps include data cleaning, transformation, and splitting, followed by feature engineering and storage for model training.

## Project Steps

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- **Cleaning:** Remove duplicates, handle missing values using imputation or removal, and ensure consistency across data types.
- **Feature Selection:** Identify relevant features by examining correlation with the target variable. Non-essential features are removed to optimize model performance.
- **Stratified Sampling:** Split data into training, validation, and test sets using stratified sampling based on key features (e.g., 'Themes' or 'Rating') to ensure balanced distribution across subsets.

### 2. **Feature Engineering**
- **Numerical Features:** Apply scaling or normalization (Min-Max or StandardScaler) to prepare data for algorithms.
- **Categorical Features:** Use one-hot encoding for nominal variables, label encoding for ordinal ones, and target encoding for high-cardinality features.
- **Text Features:** Processed using TF-IDF or Word2Vec techniques after cleaning (remove punctuation, stopwords, and special characters).
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA applied to reduce feature space when necessary.

### 3. **Data Transformation**
- Transform raw data into a model-friendly format by normalizing, scaling, or encoding based on feature type.
- Ensure text features are vectorized appropriately, and numerical features are transformed for modeling compatibility.

### 4. **Data Storage**
- **Temporary Storage:** Use Pandas DataFrames or NumPy arrays for in-memory processing.
- **Long-Term Storage:** Cleaned data stored in relational databases like MySQL/PostgreSQL or NoSQL solutions like MongoDB.
- **Cloud Storage:** Utilize AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for scalability, with encryption and access control for security.

### 5. **Model Training**
- Split the dataset into training (70%), validation (15%), and testing (15%) sets.
- Apply stratified sampling to ensure balanced representation of classes.
- Train the model using the most relevant features identified through correlation and significance analysis.
